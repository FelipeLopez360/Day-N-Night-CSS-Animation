# Day N Night CSS Animation

This project is a demo of CSS animations to create an animated scene. Includes an interactive sun that switches between a day and night mode when clicked. Additionally, it features animations for a moving car, clouds, stars, and an animated background.

### Characteristics

* The sun is an interactive part of the scene. When you click on it, the background and some visual properties change to simulate the transition between day and night.
